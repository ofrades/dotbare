# Configuration files for Pop/Ubuntu, Gnome, Neovim

I only tested this in pop!_os, but should work with ubuntu too.

This install all my required apps and tools for developement,
if you want to try it fork this repo and change `install-essential` file
to fit your needs. I use apt for installation of most things but also
flatpak to apps, like slack, etc...
I also configure automatically a barerepo under the git alias `configs`


```
git clone https://github.com/ofrades/configs
cd configs
sh install-essential.sh
```
